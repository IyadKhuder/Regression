# Regression
This Notebook is a summary of my self-learning of the Regression models. I've created a demo for each mode and applied it on a simple dataset.

In this Notebook, I'm covering the following models all together since I use the same dataset for both models, so you don't bother linking to Google Drive each time:

I. Polynomial Regression
II. SVR
III. Decision Tree
IV. Random Forest Regression
